#### &lt;form&gt; function() & .class â€“ Web Design Conference in Asia <br> 14 November 2015 in Manila, Philippines

Join the hallowed ranks of Jina Bolton, Sacha Greif, John Allsopp, Thomas Gorissen, Andrei Gonzales, Rico Sta. Cruz, and other industry greats by applying as speaker to this year's [**Form&nbsp;Function & Class 6**](http://www.formfunctionclass.com/)!

### How to Submit

All you need to do is submit a talk proposal, following these steps:

1. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/pwdo/FFC6-Call-For-Speakers/issues/new)
2. Fill in the title with your talkâ€™s title;
3. Using the [`call-for-proposal-template.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pwdo/FFC6-Call-For-Speakers/master/call-for-proposal-template.md), fill in your topic proposal and background info;
4. Hit Submit!

**What if I want to nominate a speaker?** For now we recommend that you get in touch with the potential speaker to submit the request. They'll be even more psyched to submit with encouragement from you ðŸ˜‰



## Things to consider in picking a topic
- **Audience:** FFC6 is attended by a majority of professionals and a handful of students. Of these, we have designers, developers, and managers in different combinations as purists or hybrids.
- **The sweet spot:** We try to cover our bases in Design, Branding, Typography, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Mobile, User Experience, & Business.
- **What's hot:** Performance, Animation, Interaction Design, Front-End Workflow, Email Newsletter Design.
- **FFC6 theme:** If last year was about superheroes, this year we're all about **villains**: What makes BAD design? How can user experience be EVIL? Which development practices are considered HARMFUL? Do you know enough about pixels & code to be DANGEROUS? ðŸ˜ˆ

Talk length is 45 minutes, plus 5 minutes setup time. Q&A will be done in 2 panels: morning speakers and afternoon speakers.

## Speaker Perks
- We will cover the cost of your travel and accommodations. We can also help make the arrangements if you need it.
- If your company can shoulder the airfaire & hotel costs, we'll gladly add them as a conference sponsor, with corresponding benefits.
- You'll be staying at a beautiful, relaxing hotel near the conference venue, booked for you 1 day before the conference until the day after.
- You can pick your intro music before the talk (if it matches our *villainous* theme, even better).
- If you purchased a ticket this year, we'll refund it.
- You'll get lifetime access to succeeding FFC conferences. 
- We're happy to discuss any additional concerns. ðŸ’–

The speaker lineup probably won't be complete when tickets go on sale, so in case your proposal won't be selected but you still want to attend, just let us know and we'll hold a ticket for you.
