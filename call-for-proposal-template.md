## About myself

- Name: *Effev Cee*
- Country of Origin: *Death Star*
- Occupation & Company: *Web designer at Galactic Empire*
- URL to my website: *https://effev.co*

## About my topic

*My topic is about how to avoid commiting web design sins that can totally annoy Yoda and bring him back to life by improving designs and following development standards.*

*My topic would be suitable for most designers, developers, and sith lords. Some sub-topics might be a little bit too advanced for beginners so at least 2 years of saber-playing experience is preferred but not required.*

## Additional info

- *I've spoken before at FFC 2011, JSConf Galactic & UX Tatooine.*
- *Check out a sample of my talk at: https://effev.co/watch/ffc2011*
- *I'm requesting a travel budget of 45000 Philippine Pesos to fly me and my wife from Death Star to Manila. I'm open to other options from you guys.*
